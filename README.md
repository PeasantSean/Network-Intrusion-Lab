# Network Intrusion Lab Phase 1: Setup
# README

<br>

This lab simulates a basic network intrusion detection environment using VirtualBox. It involves setting up three virtual machines, Ubuntu Desktop, Ubuntu Server (target), and Kali Linux (attacker)- connected via an internal network. 


<br>


## Goals

- Learn how to configure and interpret results from Suricata
- Simulate real-world attacks in a safe environment
- Build hands-on experience with both offensive security and network defense

<br>


## Tools

| Tool       | Purpose           |
|------------|-------------------|
| VirtualBox | VM host platform  |
| Kali Linux | Attack tools      |
| Suricata   | Intrusion detection|
| Wireshark  | Traffic analysis  |

<br>



## Lab Setup

- Ubuntu Server: Target
- Kali Linux: Attacker
- Ubuntu Desktop + Suricata: Detection
- VirtualBox / VMWare

<br>

I'm building this lab to teach myself how to execute and detect attacks in a controlled environment. My main focus is learning the ins and outs of using Suricata for intrusion detection. Along the way, Iâ€™m also gaining hands-on experience with VM networking(getting multiple machines to communicate reliably).

## Project Docs

- See `logs/`  and `troubleshooting/` for all docs related to this project. You'll find notes I took while working through everything, some troubleshooting tips, and a setup guide based on the issues I encountered. I also made a list of terminal commands I want to keep in mind for future reference.
