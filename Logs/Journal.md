# Network Intrusion Lab
<br>

I'm building this lab to teach myself how to execute and detect attacks in a controlled environment. My main focus is learning the ins and outs of using Suricata for intrusion detection. Along the way, Iâ€™m also gaining hands-on experience with VM networking(getting multiple machines to communicate reliably).

<br>


## Goals

- Learn how to configure and interpret results from Suricata
- Simulate real-world attacks in a safe environment
- Build hands-on experience with both offensive security and network defense

<br>


## Tools

| Tool       | Purpose           |
|------------|-------------------|
| VirtualBox | VM host platform  |
| Kali Linux | Attack tools      |
| Suricata   | Intrusion detection|
| Wireshark  | Traffic analysis  |

<br>



## Lab Setup

- Ubuntu Server: Target
- Kali Linux: Attacker
- Ubuntu Desktop + Suricata: Detection
- VirtualBox / VMWare

<br>




## Notes

I haven't touched GitHub or any tech-related project in months. I have to get used to working via the terminal again. And honestly, I have to build some discipline to stay consistent with this project. 

Like everyone, I have a pretty busy schedule with the kids and work. I'll squeeze as much focused, intentional time working on this as I can.
